1] Compilation instructions
---------------------------

  Prerequisites:

You will need to install the following libraries before compiling:
1. SFML 2.0: http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php

  Compiling on Linux:
  
1. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory.
2. If it does not exist, create a new directory called 'build' (or whatever you like).
3. Navigate to this new directory.
4. Invoque 'cmake':
   > cmake ../
5. 'cmake' will then tell you if any library is missing or not found. Fix the problems if any.
6. Compile everything using 'make':
   > make
7. When the process is over, the compiled binaries are placed in the 'bin' folder.
