======

"Cobalt" is the codename for a small project of turn based strategy/exploration/management game in 2D. It is programmed in modern C++ using a client/server architecture, allowing for both single an multiplayer games. It is meant to be easy to get into, yet rich enough not to be repetitive, vast and pretty if the hardware can handle it, and still playable on low performance hardware.
